% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

Deep learning is having an increasing prescence in the day to day lives of people around the world. In recent years with the improving computing capatabilities of devices the public is utlising deep learning algorithms in their day to day lives. Whether it be voice recognition systems, music recommendation algorithms, tv show recommendation algorithms, filters to warp images they all use different types of deep learning approaches. 

One of the reasons for the success of deep learning is the fact that it can learn complex non-linear functions with relatives ease. it does with the use of many hidden layers. According the universal approximation theorem \cite{} it can approximate any function. The flipside to using deep learning models is that it is difficult to understand what a deep learning model is actually learning.

This inability to understand what is being learned by a deep learning model makes it difficult to understand whether a deep learning model will perform reliably when deployed for public use. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduce the increasing importance of data and how there is an abundance of large collections of data in the world 
\item Give examples of movie collections, music streaming, personal information, instagram, youtube etc.
\item This data has facilitated research in deep learning. So a combination of an abundance of data and better computing has brought about a new age of deep learning
\item Challenge with larger datasets is mislabelling, data corruption, noise which are currently being done by mostly manual curation there is a need to work on automatic methods to curate. Practically this manifests as when you have live data coming in quickly identifying an error.
\item Challenge with deep learning is that while deploying them in the real world you need to be sure they are working well and always perform as expected, in effect they must be robust to noise
\item ROLI is interested in problems such as acoustic instrument dataset creation where high quality recordings are key, so an automatic method to identify faulty recordings that don't meet the standard
\item ROLI is interested in high accuracy and highly robust deep learning models that they can confidently release to their customers so there is a need to do research in investigating robustness
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}

I'd like to see if I can create a summary of some of the research techniques used in some of the literature I am reviewing in the form of a table to compare techniques and performance.

\subsection{What are adversarial attacks?}
Szegedy et al. \cite{szegedy_intriguing_2013} discovered that in object recognition tasks by applying an imperceptible non-random perturbation to the input image the output of the network can be changed. The term "Adversarial examples" is used to describe these perturbed examples. These adversarial examples were attributed to the fact that there are blindspots in the training process for these deep learning models.

Goodfellow, Shlens and Szegedy \cite{goodfellow_explaining_2014} challenged the idea that adversarial examples were due to blind spots in high dimensional spaces. Instead, they suggested that they are caused due to linearity in deep learning models. According to them LSTMS, ReLUs, maxout networks, CNNs etc. were intentiaonally designed to behave more linearly in order to make them easier to optimize. 

Assume we have a linear classifier defined by the relationship $y = f(x)$ where $f(x)$ is given by $f(x) = \omega^{T}x$. Our goal is to perturb the input $x$ with perturbation $\eta$ subject to the condition that $D(x+\eta,x)<\epsilon$ where $D$ is some distance measure. We can write the new equation for the ouput of the classifier as:

\begin{equation}
\tilde{y} = \omega^{T}x + \omega^{T}\eta
\end{equation}

By choosing $\eta$ carefully so that it is aligned in the direction of the weights of the classifier $\omega$ the change in the output can be maximized. 

Goodfellow, Shlens and Szegedy \cite{goodfellow_explaining_2014} used this assumption on deep learning models to generate adversarial examples and came up with a family of fast gradient approaches to generate adversarial examples. The success of these adversarial examples lent credence to the fact that deep learning models are susceptible to adversarial examples on account of being too linear.

Before we give more details about different types of adversarial attacks and defenses against these attacks we'll list the different categories of adversarial attacks. The category of an adversarial attack is determined by either the goal of the adversary or the information the adversary has of the classifier.

Goal of the adversary:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Untargeted attack - The adversary's goal is to simply misclassify the input. As long as the new target class of the classifier is different from the original the adversary has achieved its goal.
\item Targeted attack - The adversary's goal is to change the label from the original to a different label that is specified before the attack begins. Because there are more constraints in the targeted attack it is typically harder to generate targeted adversarial examples as opposed to untargeted adversarial examples.
\end{enumerate}

Information of the adversary:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perfect knowledge - In this scenario the adversary has perfect knowledge of the classifier such as the feature space, the weights of the model and the type of classifier. This is also known as a white box attack.
\item Limited knowledge - The classifier does not know the training data or the trained model but has knowledge about the feature representation and the type of classifier. This could be considered a black box attack.
\item Zero knowledge - This is a special case where an adversarial example is generated for one classifier and then tested on a different classifier which it has no information about.
\end{enumerate}

In the following sections I will introduce different techniques for attacks, different techniques for defenses and some unique properties of adversarial attacks such as universal perturbation, transferability of adversarial examples and adversarial examples in the real world. Finally I will highlight the existing body of work that explores adversarial attacks in audio and talk about existing deep learning tasks in music information retrieval (MIR) that would be a good starting point for research into adversarial attacks in music.


\subsection{Summary of attacks}

\begin{enumerate}
\item L-BFGS - Szegedy et al. \cite{szegedy} introduced a method where the goal was to solve the following optimization problem:

The exact computation of this problem is difficult so it is approximated using the box constrained L-BFGS algorithm.

\item Fast Gradient Sign Method - The goal of this method is to quickly generate a simple adversarial examples. By perturbing the input in the direction of the gradient of the weights of the model by a sufficient amount it can create an adversarial example \cite{goodfellow_explaining_2014}. Let $x$ be the input to the model and $y$ be the output, the model parameters are $\theta$. The cost function of the model is $J(\theta,x,y)$. With this information we can create an adversarial example by computing the perturbation $\eta$ using the formula:

\begin{equation}
\eta = \epsilon sign(\delta_x J(\theta,x,y))
\end{equation}

In this equation $\epsilon$ is decided manually until the formula causes a perturbation. This technique was refined by making the process iterative and computing the gradient repeatedly and showed improved results.

\item Jacobian based Saliency Map Attack - In this technique the saliency maps are used to find what part of the input has the most impact on the output and starts by changing the value of the most important. The algorithm iteratively goes down the list of most important pixels until either the distortion limit is reached or the input is misclassified successfully.
\item DeepFool - 
\item Carlini and Wagner - 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Summary of defenses}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Defensive distillation - 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Adversarial attacks in audio}
\subsection{Adversarial attacks}

Deep learning has gained a lot of popularity in recent years with success in image recognition, test-to-speech, motion tracking and singing voice transcription. The success of deep learning is attributed to the fact that large non-linear models can be trained using back propogation. The tradeoff with these complex, non-linear models is that it is difficult to interpret what is being learned by the deep learning model. 

Following this research Goodfellow, Shlens and Szegedy \cite{goodfellow_explaining_2014} suggested that adversarial examples exist due to the compounding effect of dot products through each layer of the neural network. This would mean that deep learning models are too linear. This idea can be expressed by the following equation:


If the perturbation $\eta$ is aligned with the weights then the perturbation has the potential to change the output significantly. The argument was that a lot of LSTMs, ReLUs etc. were intentially designed to behave linearly in order to make them easier to optimize. So, if we assume linearity, by using the formula listed above we can use the sign of the weights to analytically generate perturbations easily. This method for generating adversarial examples was called "fast gradient sign method".

Biggio et al. \cite{biggio_evasion_2013} approached the problem of adversarial attacks from the perspective of security and defined broadly two scenarios for attack: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Discovery of adversarial examples where small perturbations in data causes high accuracy deep learning models to misclassify the input
\item Further, these adversarial examples were transferable between different models which is alarming
\item More and more efficient and cheap ways to generate adversarial attacks were discovered in an attempt to understand the underlying problem of deep learning models
\item Simultaneous work on solving these attacks became popular with distilled learning methods
\item More state of the art approaches towards defending from attacks happened
\item Most research was in computer vision or natural language processing, Carlini found that some of these adversarial attacks work in audio as well
\item Bob Sturm showed that these attacks exist in music too
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Anomaly detection}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Summarize the survey paper on anomaly detection from 2007. This survey paper talks a lot about older approaches to anomaly detection that are still relevant

\item For mechanical failures there are deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, mostly inspired by the fact that it is harder to define the anomaly. 

\item Work done on anomaly detection in medicine to identify diseases from measurements automatically

\item Work done on anomaly detection on GTZAN dataset using classical machine learning and on mammal sound recognition
\end{enumerate}




\section{Research questions and methods}

In this section I'll list all of my ideas for this project so far which I will reference again in the timeline section. I am going to try and include block diagrams and images to make my ideas clearer.

\subsection{Recreating adversarial attack experiments in audio}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transferring adversarial examples in audio between models with identical inputs: In computer vision they found that adversarial examples generated in one model served as an adversarial example in another model. This indicates that there seems to be some fundamental way in which we train deep learning models that make them susceptible to errors
\item Can adversarial examples be played over the air: In computer vision a photo of an adversarial example taken from a phone camera still works as an adversarial example
\item Can you create a universal perturbation that has a high chance of making an audio an adversarial example: In computer vision they came up with a universal method to create an adversarial example
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Adversarial attacks for audio}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unlike computer vision audio domain uses different types of input features for deep learning. It would be interesting to see if it is possible to design an adversarial attack in the time domain that is robust to the different input representations
\item Design attacks for a specific task such as singing voice transcription. Singing voice transcription has a few different high accuracy models to work with so it is a good candidate to perform adversarial attacks on
\item Some research is done showing that mp3 compression preserves the adversarial examples but it would be interesting to try different bitrates and different compression methods
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Defenses against attacks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Apply existing defenses to the audio problem to see if they work
\item Design defenses that are tailored to the specific tasks that I choose to work on

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]

%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
Summarize the whole proposal





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%



% use section* for acknowledgment
\section*{Acknowledgment}




% Can use something like this to put references on a page
% by themselves when using endfloat and the captionsoff option.
\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
  \newpage
\fi



% trigger a \newpage just before the given reference
% number - used to balance the columns on the last page
% adjust value as needed - may need to be readjusted if
% the document is modified later
%\IEEEtriggeratref{8}
% The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:
%\IEEEtriggercmd{\enlargethispage{-5in}}

% references section

% can use a bibliography generated by BibTeX as a .bbl file
% BibTeX documentation can be easily obtained at:
% http://mirror.ctan.org/biblio/bibtex/contrib/doc/
% The IEEEtran BibTeX style support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/ieeetran/bibtex/
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{adversarial-attacks.bib}
% argument is your BibTeX string definitions and bibliography database(s)
%\bibliography{IEEEabrv,../bib/paper}
%
% <OR> manually copy in the resultant .bbl file
% set second argument of \begin to the number of references
% (used to reserve space for the reference number labels box)


% biography section
% 
% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:


% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies
%\newpage

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
